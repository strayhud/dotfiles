h1. dotfiles

This repo is a clone of Todd Werth's at http://github.com/twerth.   It has a lot of useful scripts and config files for VIM, Bash, and a few other things.

I made a few modications for my own purposes.


h2. File and directory structure

All command-line files are stored in a folder (~/config), and then linked accordingly to (.) dot files in my home directory to keep them organized, protected, and manageble.   Files are stored without the . (i.e., 'gitignore' rather than '.gitignore') and then linked with a dot from the  home directory. 

Following is the directory structure:

  * ~
  ** config
  *** bin
  *** docs
  *** etc
  **** vim
